# Sokoban

Sokoban game is an console application made by me for one of my university courses.
It is a puzzle video game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations.

App must be opened using console, user can set nickname or play as anonymous player, final scores are saved in .txt file.

Have fun!
